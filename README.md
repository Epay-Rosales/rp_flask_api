#Emily's Flask REST API Project

##Following a Real Python tutorial (and its source code, see credit below), I created a REST API with Flask using Connexion to handle HTTP requests locally. The endpoints created follow the OpenAPI specification. You can test the endpoints in the Swagger UI and they work! Well, except for the endpoint GET /people{lname}. You'll get an error by entering a last name. Entering the first name works. That's a bug i have to fix.

##The next step in the proect is to set up a persistent database with such tools as SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy. I've hit a roadblock. I keep getting an indentation error. Now, as a technical writer, that might seem like beyond my scope. I'm just glad that I got the Swagger UI up and running. I still want to complete the Real Python series (there are three), so that will be the next fix.
